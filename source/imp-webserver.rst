LiveQ Web Server
================

This component starts a tornado webserver and communicates with the :ref:`LiveQ Job Managers <imp-jobmanager>`
and :ref:`LiveQ Interpolators <imp-interpolator>` in order to serve the required data to the user.

The server accepts data via a ``WebSocket`` and sends back in real-time the results as they arrive. It also provides
some static files required for this functionality, such as the interface javascript library.
