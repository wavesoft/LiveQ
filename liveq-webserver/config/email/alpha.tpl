===SUBJECT===

Time for Virtual Atom Smashing!

===TEXT===

Hi there!

We at CERN are pleased to inform you that the first aplha version of 
the Virtual Atom Smasher game is now online! 

You are one of the very  first peple to be notified, because you registered 
to be one of our alpha testers.


What does this mean?

The game is completed, but since it's trying to convey some complex 
scientific topics, some parts might be difficult to understand or some
interface components might not be easy to use. 

So we are letting you in in the process of this game development!

After you register and log into the game, you will see a gray 'feedback'
button in the top-right corner. Use this to start a discussion in the forum
thread regarding your suggestion.

You can always visit the game forum too: https://test4theory.cern.ch/forum
(Your account is the same with the one in the game)


Let's do it!
