This is an e-mail we send to people eligible for lunch ticket.

===SUBJECT===

One step away from the lunch coupon!

===TEXT===

Congratulations %(displayName)s!

You are among one of the top 20 people that participated in the "Free Lunch" challenge and got the highest score! This means that you are eligible for your *free lunch ticket* ! 

There is one last thing left to do... you will need to fill-in the post-evaluation questionnaire from which we can measure what did you learn by playing the game.

To do so, just log-in again with your account in the game: http://test4theory.cern.ch/vas

Having done that, pass by my office in 2/R-021 to collect your lunch ticket!

Thank you again for your participation,

Ioannis Charalampidis,
Developer of Virtual Atom Smasher
