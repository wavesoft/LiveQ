One step away from the lunch coupon!

===TEXT===

Congratulations %(displayName)s!

You are one of the top 20 participants in the Free Lunch challenge for Virtual Atom Smasher. This means that you are eligible for your *free lunch ticket* !

There is one last thing we need you to do... please fill in the post-evaluation questionnaire so we can measure what you learnt by playing the game.

To do so, just log-in again with your account in the game: http://test4theory.cern.ch/vas

Having done that, pass by my office in 2/R-021 to collect your lunch ticket, before 6pm. If you can’t manage that, please contact me (ioannis.charalampidis@cern.ch) and we’ll arrange another pickup.

Thank you again for your participation, and bon appetit!

Ioannis Charalampidis,
Developer of Virtual Atom Smasher
